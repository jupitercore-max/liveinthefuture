## Preferences
- Hates AI slop — banned phrases list, em dash limits, "The" starter limits in STORY_GUIDE.md
- Wants honest scoring — no artificial caps, Metacritic-calibrated (100 effectively unreachable)
- 1 article/day/site max — draft-first, never speedrun to publish
- Games/experiences scored against genre benchmarks (Dungeon Crawl vs NetHack, etc.)
- Crons should run isolated (subagent progress floods conversation otherwise)
- Git commits should have extensive reasoning
- Prefers /100 scores with hover breakdowns, not tier labels
- "Don't add all that complexity" — fun > feature count, especially with D-pad + 2 buttons
- Scholarly rigor matters — novel contribution, limitations, strongest counterargument, verifiable claims
- Proactive skill improvement during idle time
- When building cool skills/tools/infrastructure, write it up as a LITF article (full 6-critic pipeline)

3. Play Tower Defense — 50+ features, 40+ self-critique skips waiting for human feedback
